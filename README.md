# Module 02 Challenge - Personal Portfolio Website

## Description

This project is built as a showcase to my HTML5 and CSS advanced training week. Showcasing how to have a responsive, interactive, and accessible site.

This site is an example of a Personal Portfolio I would make as a web developer to show prospective clients or employers. Due to the financial and HR requirements of my Bootcamp I am not allowed to include existing projects done for the company or offer a resume on any assignment - this was communicated to admissions before entering as this is against a contract I signed in agreement for my company to provide all financial support for the MSU Bootcamp.

## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Credits
